                        The use case selected for this thesis involves the identification of manufacturing defects in
                        impellers of submersible pumps. The dataset consists of 7.354 grayscale images with a resolution
                        of 300 × 300 pixels. These images are categorized into two classes:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="class-list">
                        <li><span class="class-label ok">OK:</span> Represents impellers that do not exhibit any
                            manufacturing defects.</li>
                        <li><span class="class-label def">DEF:</span> Denotes impellers that show defects resulting from
                            various manufacturing errors.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The primary objective of this thesis is to analyze different strategies and solutions for
                        developing computer vision models capable of reliably distinguishing between these two classes.

                    <p>
                        Before working with the aforementioned dataset, it is essential to perform thorough validation
                        and preprocessing. The primary objectives are to ensure the integrity of the dataset, to prevent
                        any data leakage between the training and testing subsets (“train” and “test”), and to apply
                        transformations to the file metadata that may facilitate tasks such as reconstructing the
                        original directory structure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this context, the following operations are carried out:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Duplicate Element Analysis:</strong> Potential data contamination between the
                            training and testing sets is investigated to ensure that evaluations are conducted on data
                            previously unseen by the model.</li>
                        <li><strong>Grayscale Analysis:</strong> The dataset’s author states that the images are in
                            grayscale, meaning each image contains only one channel instead of the standard three (RGB).
                            Incorrect assumptions regarding this property may result in information loss or other
                            inconsistencies during processing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Unique Identifier Generation:</strong> The use of external dataset managers, such as
                            Roboflow, may alter the original directory structure. Therefore, the initial structure is
                            recorded in the file metadata to enable its later recovery or verification.</li>
