          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <p>
            In all modern manufacturing processes, it is essential to observe and validate the condition of components
            at
            the output stage. This validation not only ensures the integrity of the physical elements, but also enables
            the extraction of valuable contextual information about the entire production chain—ranging from raw
            materials
            to the influence of external factors such as personnel and machinery.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within the framework of Industry 4.0, this necessity translates into the demand for enhanced quality control
            techniques capable of meeting increasingly stringent standards. In this context, and driven by rapid
            advancements in processing hardware, computer vision has emerged as a powerful and viable solution.
          </p>
          <p>
            Computer vision refers to a set of techniques for acquiring, processing, analyzing, and interpreting images
            of
            the real world in order to generate discrete information that can be processed by digital systems.

          <h1>Motivation</h1>
          <p>
            As manufacturing systems evolve toward full automation, the need for faster, more reliable quality
            inspection
            methods becomes increasingly critical. Manual inspections are often subjective and inconsistent, while
            traditional rule-based vision systems struggle with subtle or previously unseen defects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Automating defect detection using computer vision addresses these limitations by improving inspection speed,
            accuracy, and repeatability. This is particularly vital in high-stakes industries such as aerospace,
            automotive, and pharmaceuticals, where undetected defects can result in costly recalls and safety hazards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Modern computer vision techniques enable real-time, pixel-level analysis, reducing waste and ensuring
            compliance with rigorous quality standards. These capabilities align closely with the goals of Industry 4.0,
            making automated visual inspection a strategic priority for contemporary manufacturing.
